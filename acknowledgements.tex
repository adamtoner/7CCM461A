\section*{Acknowledgements}

In memory of my father, Christopher Toner, rest in peace. You were my teacher and my inspiration. Never has someone shaped my thinking and outlook so profoundly. I owe to you everything and myself; thank you.

And thank you to my mother, Tracey Toner, for the continued and unrivalled support you have always shown me; for getting me through the toughest times. You are my role model.

I would like to give a special mention to Mr Michael Doyle. You helped me throughout my schooling and allowed me to explore my curiosities notwithstanding regulation. Thank you.

Thank you to my dissertation supervisor, Javier Rubio, and my personal tutor, Alexander Pushnitski, for helping me when I was struggling. 

Lizzie Flittner, you absolute legend, the legibility of this dissertation is down to you. And lastly, I couldn't have done this without support of friends: \'Eimear Loughran, James Houghton, Dasha Isaeva, Navya Arora, Joss Barber, Jack Breen, Grace Whitby, and the rest - you know who you are. Thank you all.
