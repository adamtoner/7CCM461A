\section*{Acknowledgements}

In memory of my father, Christopher Toner, rest in peace. You were my teacher and my inspiration. Never has someone shaped my thinking and outlook so profoundly. I owe to you everything and myself; thank you.

And thank you to my mother, Tracey Toner, for the continued and unrivalled support you have always shown me; for getting me through the toughest times. You are my role model.

I would like to give a special mention to Mr Michael Doyle. You helped me throughout my schooling and allowed me to explore my curiosities notwithstanding regulation. Thank you.
